Understanding Test Automation Frameworks: TestNG vs. Cucumber with Java

# Cucumber and Test NG

### **TestNG (Test Next Generation): Test Framework**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ It is an open-source test framework for the Java programming language. It aims to simplify and strengthen the test process.

</aside>

**Inspired by** the JUnit test framework and added many new features.

### **Cucumber: Test Framework**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ It is a test automation tool that supports the BDD (Behavior Driven Development) approach. This approach enables collaboration in writing, understanding, and verifying functional requirements in software projects.

</aside>

Cucumber also allows you to create Step Definitions. Step Definitions are code snippets that link the steps in Gherkin scenarios to Java code.

# Differences and Similarities between TestNG and Cucumber

---

## **Differences:**

**TestNG:**

- Uses Java annotations* to define test scenarios.
- Allows you to control the order* and dependencies of tests.
- It has robust documentation and a large user community.

**Cucumber:**

- It uses the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach.
- Defines test scenarios with Gherkin text files written in natural language.
- Matches step definitions with Java code.
- Facilitates execution and reporting of tests.
- Can align test scenarios with business requirements and enable collaboration among business analysts, developers, and testers.

---

## **Similarities:**

- They are open-source frameworks for test automation.
- They support unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Enable reusability of test scenarios.
- Present test results in report formats.
- Provide logging capabilities for reporting and debugging.
- Have features for running tests in parallel or in batches.
- Can be integrated with popular CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tools (Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI, etc.).
- Both are tightly integrated into the Java ecosystem and offer more features and functionality. Java is recommended to fully leverage their potential.
    
    **Example:**
    
    - When using TestNG with Java, you can easily control the order* and dependencies of your tests.
    
    ```java
    
    @Test(priority = 1)
    public void test1() {
      // ...
    }
    
    @Test(priority = 2)
    public void test2() {
      // ...
    }
    
    @Test(dependsOnMethods = {"test1", "test2"})
    public void test3() {
      // ...
    }
    
    ```
    
    ```python
    
    from unittest import TestCase, sortTestMethods
    
    class TestExample(TestCase):
    
        test_methods = sortTestMethods([
            'test_example3',
            'test_example2',
            'test_example1',
        ])
    
        def test_example1(self):
            # ...
    
        def test_example2(self):
            # ...
    
        def test_example3(self):
            # ...
    
    ```
    
    - When using Cucumber with Java, you can easily match step definitions with Java code.
    
    ```java
    
    @Given("^I am on the login page$")
    public void onLoginPage() {
      // ...
    }
    
    @When("^I enter my username and password$")
    public void enterCredentials() {
      // ...
    }
    
    @Then("^I should be logged in$")
    public void loggedIn() {
      // ...
    }
    
    ```
    
    ```ruby
    
    require 'cucumber'
    
    Given /^I am on the login page$/ do
      # ...
    end
    
    When /^I enter my username and password$/ do
      # ...
    end
    
    Then /^I should be logged in$/ do
      # ...
    end
    
    ```
    
    ### **Advantages of Using Java:**
    
    1. **Widespread Usage:** Java is a popular programming language with a large developer community, so using Cucumber framework with Java allows you to benefit from a wide community and resource pool.
    2. **Integration Ease:** Java, being widely used in the industry, can be easily integrated with other components written in Java.
    3. **Performance:** Java is known as a performance-oriented language. Therefore, it can provide better performance when processing large and complex test scenarios.
    4. **Development Tools:** Java has a rich development ecosystem. Integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA provide useful tools for writing and managing Java-based Cucumber tests.
        1. "Cucumber for Java" plugin.

### **TestNG may be a better choice in these cases:**

- If you need more types of tests.
- If you want more control and flexibility.
- If you need to integrate it into an existing Java project.

### **Cucumber may be a better choice in these cases:**

- If you want to use the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach.
- If you want to write test scenarios in natural language.
- If you want to facilitate communication with stakeholders.

**Differences and Similarities between TestNG and Cucumber:**

| Feature | TestNG | Cucumber |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test Approach | Traditional | Behavior Driven Development (BDD) |
| Test Scenario Language | Java annotations* | Gherkin |
| Java Integration | Required | Required |
| Test Types | Unit, integration, end-to-end | Unit, integration, end-to-end |
| Reporting | Detailed reports | Simple reports |

**Consider these factors when deciding which framework to choose.**

# **Additional Information and Details**

### **Annotations**

**TestNG Annotations:**

- **@Test:**Â Defines a test method.
- **@BeforeTest:**Â Executed once before a test class.
- **@AfterTest:**Â Executed once after a test class.
- **@BeforeMethod:**Â Executed before each test method.
- **@AfterMethod:**Â Executed after each test method.
- **@BeforeClass:**Â Executed as a static method before a test class.
- **@AfterClass:**Â Executed as a static method after a test class.
- **@Test(groups = {"group1", "group2"}):**Â Assigns a test method to one or more groups.
- **@BeforeGroups:**Â Executed before tests in specified groups start.
- **@AfterGroups:**Â Executed after tests in specified groups finish.
- **@Parameters:**Â Used to pass parameters to a test method.
- **@DataProvider:**Â Used to provide data to a test method.
- **@ExpectedExceptions:**Â Specifies which exceptions a test method should throw.
- **@Ignore:**Â Used to ignore a test method or class.
- **@Timeout:**Â Prevents a test method from exceeding a specified time.
- **@DependsOnMethods:**Â Specifies that a test method depends on other test methods.

### **Sequencing**

The **`priority`** attribute determines the order in which tests will run.
The **`dependsOnMethods`** attribute determines that a test will run after other tests have completed.

### **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment**. It encompasses a set of practices and principles used to automate the integration, testing, and delivery of code changes continuously throughout the software development process.

**CI/CD Tools:**

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**Â Enables automated merging, testing, and error detection with every code change.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):**Â Facilitates the automatic deployment of developed code to production or testing environments.

**Benefits of CI/CD Tools:**

- Accelerates the software development process.
- Improves software quality.
- Reduces deployment risks.
- Enhances team productivity.

**Popular CI/CD Tools:**

- **Jenkins:**Â An open-source, popular CI/CD tool.
- **GitHub Actions:**Â A CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub.
- **Azure DevOps:**Â A CI/CD platform provided by Microsoft.
- **GitLab CI:**Â A CI/CD tool integrated with GitLab.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**

A software development team is working on a new feature for a web application. The team is manually performing the following steps with each code change:

- Submits code changes to a repository.
- Manually merges code changes.
- Manually runs tests.
- Manually fixes errors.
- Manually deploys code to production.

**Using a CI/CD Tool:**

The team can automate this process using a CI/CD tool like Jenkins. The tool will automatically perform the following steps with each code change:

- Retrieves code changes from a repository.
- Automatically merges code changes.
- Runs unit tests and integration tests automatically.
- Automatically reports errors.
- Deploys code to production automatically if tests pass.
